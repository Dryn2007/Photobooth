# Sound Files

This directory contains sound files used for various interactions in the PhotoBooth application:

- `beep.mp3`: Used for countdown timer beeps
- `camera-shutter.mp3`: Used when a photo is captured
- `success.mp3`: Used when a QR code is successfully validated

Note: In a real application, you would need to obtain or create these sound files. For this prototype, you may need to add appropriate sound files to this directory.

Sound file licensing:
- For a production application, ensure you have appropriate licenses for all sound files used
- Consider using royalty-free sound effects from sites like Freesound.org, SoundBible, or ZapSplat
